# Decred FPGA Miner Demo

This is a demo of an FPGA miner for Decred using the Xilinx Spartan-6 LX9 chip.  It's a very simple design that doesn't include any optimizations or a PLL that mines at 4Mh/s using a 50mhz clock.  It is for demonstration purposes only.  You won't be able to mine any coins using an LX9 fpga, you'll need much larger fpga boards.
